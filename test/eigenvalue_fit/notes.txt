We need to find a reasonable loss function: relative difference/absolute difference/squared difference. This depends a lot on the applications. Consider metrics on 1/lambda may be a good idea.

try true mean: use xmu
look at the codes for measurment errors: only affect the diagonal. We probably
need to modify the fit method for error 0

Perhaps we should try MLE, but there is no available codes.
